The libraries of python:

1)Pandas:Pandas is a powerful open-source data analysis and manipulation library for Python.It provides data strucutres like series and dataframe. With Pandas, you can perform a wide range of operations, including data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation.

2)Numpy:Numpy library is mostly used for numbers,arrays,numerical part. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.The library includes a wide range of mathematical functions for operations like linear algebra, statistical calculations.

3)Tensorflow:machine-learning library developed by google widely used for building and deploying ai models.It provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools,libraries.Tensorflow developed models can easily be run on any platforms like mobile.ensorFlow offers high-level APIs like Keras, which simplify the process of building and training neural networks.

4)keras:keras is an open source high level neural network API's written in python,developed to enable fast experimentation with deep learning models.

5)sklearn:most popular library in which we use supervised and unsupervised machine learning.Its actually scikit-learn but libary name is sklearn.we can do regression, classification, clustering.. through sklearn

6)Pytourch: PyTorch is a free tool made by Facebook for building and training machine learning models.PyTorch lets you change the way your model works while itâ€™s running, making it easier to experiment and debug.PyTorch comes with extra libraries for specific tasks, like TorchVision for image processing and TorchText for working with text, making it easier to build different kinds of models.
